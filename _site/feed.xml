During the interview, we discussed our mission to create safer and more inclusive traffic environments for individuals with disabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By collecting advanced sensor data from diverse populations, our work focuses on understanding the unique challenges faced by road users with reduced mobility. This involves collecting and analyzing motion patterns, identifying obstacles, and examining environmental factors through interviews, video analysis, and multi-sensor data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The insights from this research will drive the development of AI-powered systems to enhance traffic monitoring and foster safer conditions for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

Our initiative involves an AI-equipped vehicle that films and analyzes the movement patterns of pedestrians, with a particular focus on participents with mobility challenges. By collaborating closely with these individuals, we aim to develop a system that not only improves their safety but also contributes to a more inclusive traffic environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research vehicle, Snowfox (a Volvo XC90), is equipped with state-of-the-art automotive sensors. It is provided by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.chalmers.se/en/infrastructure/revere/&quot;&gt;REVERE lab at Chalmers&lt;/a&gt; and supported by sponsorship from Volvo Cars.&lt;/p&gt;
