### Creating an Inclusivity Index for Digital Twin (IIDT) Transportation Systems  
**Project ID:** Inclusivity Index  
**Funding Period:** January 2025-01 to December 2026  
**Funding Agency:** Transport Area of Advance (Dnr: SOT C 2024-0299-37)

**Overview:**  
A digital twin in transportation systems is a virtual replica that includes data and its semantics, simulating real-world conditions. This project focuses on ensuring inclusivity in digital twins, addressing potential biases in AI-driven decision-making.

**Why It Matters:** 
- **Inclusivity in AI Development:** If digital twins fail to represent underrepresented groups (e.g., people with disabilities and the elderly), AI systems may inherit these gaps, leading to biased outcomes.
- **Accurate Representation:** Comprehensive data from diverse population ensure AI systems function effectively and equitably in real-world scenarios.
- **Innovation through Metrics:** Developing indexes to assess the inclusivity and diversity of digital twins promotes fair and reliable AI systems.

**Key Goals:**
- Ensure representation of all population groups, including those with mobility challenges.
- Develop tools and metrics to assess and improve inclusivity in digital twins.
- Support fair and accurate automated decision-making in transportation systems.
