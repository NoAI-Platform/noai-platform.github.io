### Creating an Inclusivity Index for Digital Twin (IIDT) Transportation Systems
**Project ID:** Inclusivity Index
**Funding Period:** January 2025-01 to December 2026
**Funding Agency:** Transport Area of Advance (Dnr: SOT C 2024-0299-37)

**Overview:**
A digital twin in transportation systems is a virtual replica that includes data and its semantics, simulating real-world conditions. This project focuses on ensuring inclusivity in digital twins, addressing potential biases in AI-driven decision-making.

**Why It Matters:** 
- **Inclusivity in AI Development:** If digital twins fail to represent underrepresented groups (e.g., people with disabilities and the elderly), AI systems may inherit these gaps, leading to biased outcomes.
- **Accurate Representation:** Comprehensive data from diverse population ensure AI systems function effectively and equitably in real-world scenarios.
- **Innovation through Metrics:** Developing indexes to assess the inclusivity and diversity of digital twins promotes fair and reliable AI systems.

**Objectives:**
- Ensure representation of all population groups, including those with mobility challenges.
- Develop tools and metrics to assess and improve inclusivity in digital twins.
- Support fair and accurate automated decision-making in transportation systems.

### InfraHelper: Enhancing Digital Twins and Universal Design with Multimodal Data
**Project ID:** InfraHelper
**Funding Period:** July 2025 to December 2025
**Collaboration:** City of Gothenburg (SLK-2025-00073)

**Overview:**
This pilot study focuses on human-centered road analysis for digital twin modeling and universal design using multimodal data. The project aims to create more inclusive and accessible urban infrastructure through advanced data integration.

**Objectives:**
- **Enrich Digital Twin Models:** Integrate multimodal data to enhance digital twin models of Gothenburg's city infrastructure
- **Support Universal Design:** Implement design principles that ensure accessibility and inclusivity for all road users
