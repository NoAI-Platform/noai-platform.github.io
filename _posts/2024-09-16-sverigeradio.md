Our research was recently featured on Vetenskapsradion Sveriges Radio P1. During the interview, we discussed our mission to create safer and more inclusive traffic environments for individuals with disabilities. 

By collecting advanced sensor data from diverse populations, our work focuses on understanding the unique challenges faced by road users with reduced mobility. This involves collecting and analyzing motion patterns, identifying obstacles, and examining environmental factors through interviews, video analysis, and multi-sensor data. 

The insights from this research will drive the development of AI-powered systems to enhance traffic monitoring and foster safer conditions for everyone.
