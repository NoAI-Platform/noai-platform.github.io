We are excited to announce our collaboration with the City of Gothenburg on the **InfraHelper** project - a pilot study focusing on human-centered road analysis for digital twin modeling and universal design using multimodal data!

## Project Overview

Running from July 1 to December 31, 2025, this project has two main objectives:

- To enrich digital twin models of Gothenburgâ€™s city infrastructure with multimodal data.
- To support universal design principles that ensure accessibility and inclusivity for all road users.

## Impact

The InfraHelper project will contribute to:
- Enhanced digital twin models through multimodal data collection.
- Safer roads supported by monitoring and predictive analysis.
- More inclusive urban planning that considers the needs of all citizens.
- Better decision-making tools for city planners and traffic managers.

Stay tuned for updates as we progress through this exciting initiative to make Gothenburg's streets safer and more accessible for everyone!
