We are delighted to have been featured on Sveriges Radio P4 Göteborg, where our innovative project aimed at enhancing traffic safety for individuals with disabilities was highlighted. Our initiative involves an AI-equipped vehicle that films and analyzes the movement patterns of pedestrians, with a particular focus on participents with mobility challenges. By collaborating closely with these individuals, we aim to develop a system that not only improves their safety but also contributes to a more inclusive traffic environment. 

The research vehicle, Snowfox (a Volvo XC90), is equipped with state-of-the-art automotive sensors. It is provided by the [REVERE lab at Chalmers](https://www.chalmers.se/en/infrastructure/revere/) and supported by sponsorship from Volvo Cars.
